Free node.js container for HARTING MICA

Node.js is an open-source project which is hosted by the Node.js Foundation1 and a collaborative
project of the Linux foundation2. It implements a light weighted JavaScript runtime built on the
Chrome V8 engine and provides an event-driven architecture and a non-blocking I/O API designed
to optimize an applicationâ€™s throughput and scalability for real-time Web applications. The built-in
library allows Node.js applications to act as a stand alone Web server. Node.js projects can be
managed and hosted by the npm-package manager, which claims to provide the largest
ecosystem of open-source libraries in the world.

Note that the Node.js Environment Container is currently based on Node.js v2.4.2. For more
informaton about Node.js and NPM visit https://nodejs.org/en/ and https://www.npmjs.com/.

This LXC container provides basic node.js functionality for the HARTING MICA computing appliance. It is intended for experimentation and development, but should not be used for production.
